# The Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle is one of the SOLID principles, 
and it focuses on the design of interfaces in object-oriented programming. 
ISP states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does 
not use. In other words, clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces 
they don't use.

The core idea behind ISP is to keep interfaces small, specific, and cohesive. 
This ensures that implementing classes only need to provide implementations 
for the methods relevant to their context.
