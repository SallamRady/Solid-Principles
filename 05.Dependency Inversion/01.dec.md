#   The Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle is the final principle in the SOLID
acronym, and it focuses on the relationships between high-level modules and
low-level modules. DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions. In addition, abstractions should not depend on details, 
but details should depend on abstractions.
